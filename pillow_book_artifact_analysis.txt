PILLOW BOOK PASSAGE ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
========================================

Passage: "Someone who has been serving as a mere maid-of-honour is appointed to be the nurse of an Imperial Prince. She no longer bothers with a Chinese jacket or a formal skirt, and, weaving a simple white dress, she lies down next to the young prince and stays with him inside his curtain-dais. Summoning her former colleagues, she sends them to her room with messages or gives them letters to deliver. Words do not suffice to describe her behaviour.

What a splendid thing it is for a Subordinate Official in the Emperor's Private Office when he is promoted to the rank of Chamberlain! One cannot believe that he is the same man who last year in the Eleventh Month had to carry a zither during the Special Festival. When one sees him walking along in the company of young noblemen, one really wonders where he can have sprung from. This applies also to men who have been given the rank of Chamberlain after serving in other offices, but in their case the change is not quite so impressive."
